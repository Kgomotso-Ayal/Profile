        <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Kgomotso Bonga</span><br>Below is the information about my experience learning Web Design</h1>

            <p><br>Learning web design has been an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience for me. Over the past few months, I have dedicated myself to understanding the intricacies of this field, and it has allowed me to explore my creativity in ways I never imagined.

                <br>In the beginning, web design seemed like a daunting task. The vast array of programming languages and design principles overwhelmed me. However, I was determined to learn and grow in this field. I started with the basics, learning HTML and CSS. These foundational skills gave me a solid understanding of how websites are structured and styled.
        
                 <br>As I progressed further into my learning journey, I delved into more advanced concepts such as JavaScript and responsive design. JavaScript allowed me to add interactivity and dynamic elements to my websites, creating a more engaging user experience. Responsive design taught me how to adapt websites to different screen sizes, catering to the growing number of mobile users.
                <br>
                <br>One of the most memorable aspects of learning web design has been the opportunity to apply my knowledge through hands-on projects. Building my own websites from scratch has given me invaluable real-world experience. It has helped me understand the importance of user-centered design, accessibility, and usability.
                
                <br>Alongside practical projects, I have also sought out online courses and tutorials that provided expert guidance in specific areas of web design. These resources not only expanded my technical knowledge but also exposed me to current trends and best practices in the industry.
                
                <br>Perhaps one of the most gratifying moments throughout this learning process was when I completed my first professional website for a local business owner. Seeing their satisfaction with the final product confirmed that all my hard work had paid off. It reinforced my passion for web design and motivated me to continue honing my skills.
                <br>
                <br>In conclusion, learning web design has been an exhilarating journey filled with challenges, growth, and rewards. From mastering HTML and CSS to exploring JavaScript and responsive design, each step has contributed to shaping me into a proficient web designer. The hands-on experience, coupled with online courses and tutorials, has helped me develop a deep understanding of user-centered design and industry best practices. I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in web design, knowing that there is always something new to learn in this ever-evolving field.
